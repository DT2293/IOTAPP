# üî• FIRE ALERT IoT SYSTEM
**Fire Alert IoT** is a real-time fire monitoring and alerting system built from scratch using **ESP32**, a custom **Node.js backend**, and a **Flutter mobile application**. The system detects critical fire indicators such as smoke, flame, and abnormal temperature or humidity, and immediately pushes notifications via **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** ‚Äî even when the app is closed.
---
## üìå Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, flame, and smoke levels.
- Immediate fire alert notifications sent to users via FCM.
- Remote control buzzer from the Flutter app.
- JWT-based user authentication and device access control.
- All communication and data processing handled Node.js server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

  ![alt text](img/image.png)
## üì± Flutter Mobile App
- Displays live sensor data (temperature, humidity, smoke).
- Controls hardware remotely (buzzer).
- Supports user login and multi-device management (via `deviceId`).
- Receives real-time updates through WebSocket.
- Push notifications powered by Firebase Cloud Messaging (even when app is terminated).

|---------------------|----------------------|
| DS3231 (RTC)        | SDA: 16, SCL: 17     |
| OLED                | SDA: 21, SCL: 22     |
| Buzzer              | GPIO 15              |
| Flame Sensor        | D0 ‚Üí GPIO 34;A0 ‚Üí GPIO 32      |
| Traffic LEDs        | Red: 27, Yellow: 26, Green: 25 |
| DHT22               | GPIO 4                |
| MQ2                  A0 ‚Üí GPIO 33  D0 ‚Üí GPIO 13|

ESP32 collects sensor data and communicates directly with the Node.js backend using HTTP and WebSocket.

## üß∞ Installation Guide

  ### 1. ESP32 Firmware

- Developed with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
- Send sensor data to your backend via HTTP or WebSocket.

  ### 2. Backend (Node.js)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DT2293/IOTAPP.git
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # Fill in MongoDB URI, JWT secret, FCM key, etc.
npm start
node server_main.js #run server
